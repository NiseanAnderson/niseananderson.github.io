 <p> one way we can help theses helpless animals is by getting them in a shelter so they 
can be adopted by people that actually love them and they will know what a
real family bond is and they will know they are loved .Also we can make sure that
whoever was abusing there animals they get arrested and pay for how bad they 
treated there animal .</p>
